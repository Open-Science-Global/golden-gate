# Golden Gate Simulation

We create this software to run a one time simulation of Golden Gate using Poly package as the main resource. We created an abstraction that will make Golden Gate more easily receive a list of sequences.

With this package will be possible to run a Golden Gate easily in other softwares and a Colab Notebooks. Other functions will be created to improve this functionallity:

- Reannotate the final sequence using the annotations of the parts used in the Golden Gate
- Rerun the finder function to check if a new problem emerge from the reaction
